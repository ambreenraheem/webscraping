🌐 If you're a data analyst who loves working with new and real-world datasets, web scraping is a powerful way to explore and analyze fresh data directly from the source.

By using Python’s amazing libraries — like Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, lxml, Requests, BeautifulSoup4, Scrapy, Selenium, OpenPyXL, and HTML5lib — you can collect data from websites based on your client’s needs and turn it into valuable insights.

And with Power BI’s stunning visualizations, you can transform that data into powerful dashboards and reports that drive decisions and tell compelling stories.

We live in a world full of data — every individual, business, and platform has its own unique and interesting datasets. For me, uncovering and analyzing these datasets doubles the excitement and joy of working in data analytics.
